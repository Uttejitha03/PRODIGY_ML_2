# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is a common marketing technique that involves dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics. In this project, we use the K-means algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history, specifically their annual income and spending score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Mall_Customers.csv`, which contains the following columns:

- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
- Gender: Gender of the customer (Male or Female)
- Age: Age of the customer
- Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
- Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned to the customer based on their spending behavior and purchasing data

## Files

- `customer_segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for customer segmentation using K-means clustering.
- `Mall_Customers.csv`: Dataset file containing customer data.
